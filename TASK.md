This final assigment of the section "Development with a framework" will define your grade for this course.

The aim is to utilize each and every phase we've gone through, meaning that you will have:

    .NET Core MVC Application, that includes
    ✔️Routing
    ✔️Authorization
    ✔️Authentication
    ✔️Model passing to views
    ✔️Viewmodels
    ✔️Form validation (Model attribute based)
    ✔️Anti-forgery token validation
    ✔️Partial views
    ✔️Ajax call
    ✔️Data visualization library
    ✔️A database (SQL or Mongo)
    Optional: Blazor component

Your goal is to create a personal finance tracker software.

Users can register to your web application. After registering, they are able to easily add their monthly expenses
with their respective categories, such as "Gasoline for car, category: Car", or "Rent, category: Living".

You can design the data structure as you wish.

From this data, you should create a data visualization chart or grid, using a JS -library and also calculate days
until the next payday (or end of given period), daily expense rate, potential savings per month, which can also be
done by setting personal saving goal and giving rough estimate budget of daily expense maximum for the goals to be met.
